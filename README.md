# Taggregator

Taggregator is a tool for Etsy sellers to get the most out of the available tags on their listing.

In your Esty keywords, you have 13 slots, and each slot has enough room for 20 characters. That's 260 character's worth of keywords, including spaces. If you are very careful, you can pack around 35 different keywords into that space.

What this tool does is looks at your list of keywords, compares their lengths, and then figures out how to tetris them into the 13 slots as efficiently as possible, making sure as may of those 260 characters are filled up with words.

## Usage

Paste keywords in Keywords box and press Generate. Tags will appear in Tags box. Words that wouldn't fit will appear in Unused box.
